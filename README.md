# hue-pi-app
A simple Hue app to control your Hue lights.

The intention for this project is to create some small python scripts that you can run on your Raspberry Pi, Odroid, or any (small) computer that is up in your house anyway. So while it's running it can alert you of:

* incoming rain alert (in the Netherlands you can use the "buienradar" API for your location)
* clothing advice in the morging (grab your local weather forecast, and let the lights say how warm you should clothe)
* ... and any IFTTT you want to implement your own

### Alpha phase warning
This project is still in an alpha phase, so a lot of things will change. 

### This is a learning project
This is my first Python project, so I'm still figuring out the best practices — doing things the *Pythonic* way — and the quirks of Python. 

So if you have an improvement to the code, please add a pull request. 
And if you have a suggestion, you are very welcome to add an issue!
